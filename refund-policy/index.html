<p><strong>Refund Eligibility:</strong></p>

<p>While purchasing a ticket, if an user&#39;s payment succeeds but due to any technical error, the subsequent changes fails to be implemented to the account, then the user will automatically receive a refund between 5 and 10 business days. The refund ID will also be visible on user&#39;s screen at that very moment. However, if the auto-refund system too fails, then the user can contact us and we shall either process a 100% refund or issue a new ticket as per user&#39;s demand, in this scenario.</p>
